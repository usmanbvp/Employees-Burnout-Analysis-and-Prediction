# Employees Burnout Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the Employees Burnout Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains all the resources and materials needed to analyze and predict employee burnout based on various factors.

## Project Overview

Employee burnout is a significant concern in the workplace. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to analyze employee burnout and provide insights for effective prevention and management strategies. By understanding the factors contributing to burnout and developing prediction models, we aim to identify at-risk employees and provide targeted support.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for this project contains anonymized employee data with relevant features, including demographic information, job-related factors, psychometric assessments, and burnout indicators. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure data quality and privacy.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- [`data`](data/employee_burnout_analysis.xlsx): Contains the dataset used for analysis and prediction.
- [`notebooks`](Employees-Burnout-Analysis-and-Prediction.ipynb): Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- [`Analysis`](EmployeesBurnoutAnalysis.pbix):This power bi providing easily interpretable data visualizations, for a clear understanding of the dataset at hand.
- [`models`](model.pkl): Contains trained models for predicting employee burnout.
- [`README`](README.md): The readme file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/usmanbvp/Employees-Burnout-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
```
2.Set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies.

3.Explore the dataset in the data directory and familiarize yourself with the data structure and features.

4.Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to perform data exploration, develop the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

5.Once you have trained and evaluated the models, you can save them  for future use.
Then you may deploy the project.
