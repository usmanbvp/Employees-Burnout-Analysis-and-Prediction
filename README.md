    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the burnout rate of an
        employee based on various factors. By understanding the factors contributing to burnout and developing prediction
        models, we aim to identify at-risk employees and provide targeted support.</p>
